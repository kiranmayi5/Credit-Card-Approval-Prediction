This academic project focuses on predicting credit card approvals using a dataset that includes various consumer characteristics such as income, credit card expenditure, and homeownership. The project involved building two predictive models using linear regression and MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) models in R. The goal was to develop models that could effectively predict whether a credit card application would be approved, enabling companies to make better targeting and decision-making strategies.

Project Overview:

- Data Exploration: Conducted initial data analysis to understand key features influencing credit card approvals.
- Predictive Modeling: Developed and tuned two predictive models using different combinations of variables and cross-validation techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance based on out-of-sample mean-squared error and adjusted model specifications to improve predictive accuracy.
